start and resume sessions
counting numbers!

## TODO

show a history/list of numbers 
analytics... see if there's a "pattern" or whatever...
display/visualize numbers etc... in nice charts/graphs (horizontal line column graphs?, sorted in descending order?)
add tables? 
add viewing how different sessions went...
API calls? 
maybe even show the R/B... parts... 
which parts of the board has shown up the most... 

really just to determine whether the board is biased or not... 

remove/change private key before deploying on prod.
